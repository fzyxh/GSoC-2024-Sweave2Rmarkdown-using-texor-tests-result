== Wiki Creole

You can make things **bold** or //italic// or **//both//** or //**both**//.

Character formatting extends across line breaks: **bold,
this is still bold. This line deliberately does not end in star-star.

Not bold. Character formatting does not cross paragraph boundaries.

You can use [[internal links]] or [[http://www.wikicreole.org|external links]],
give the link a [[internal links|different]] name.
